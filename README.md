# RememberThatOneTime
Work Day Scheduler
## Description

This project was to convert code with basic HTML and CSS into an interactive daily scheduler that will commit saved text into the local storage of the computer accessing it and accessing that text when the page is refreshed.

This page also color codes the hours by what time of day it is utilizing the day.js site.

## Usage

To use this application, the user should enter text into the area next to the hour of the day you intend to leave a note for and click the save icon to the right of the row when this is completed.

The text will be saved even when the url is refreshed and the current hour's row will appear in red to alert the user.
